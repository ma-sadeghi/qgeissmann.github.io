*The mill on pedals!*

## The wondermill

A couple of years ago, I purchased a "[Wondermill Junior](http://www.thewondermill.com/index.php/module/statics/action/view_listing/page/53)", which is a basically a benchtop hand-powered mill.
The -- comedic and exhaustive -- promotional videos do a good job at promoting this thing of beauty, so I will jump straight to the point.
I was using it quite often, especially to make pea and buckwheat flour -- or peanut butter and sesame paste, using the stainless steel stones.

The point I love about the mill:

* Fresh flower -- one can keep seeds and mill them on demand which increases tastes and shelflife.
* Money saving --  often, buying a bulk of seeds is a lot cheaper than flour.
* Versatility -- one does not need to store both flour and grains of the same crop. One can also make flour of less industrial (*e.g.* foraged goods)
* Exercise -- it is a nice way to move a bit after a long day of work, and it is silent enough that one can listen to a podcast at the same time
* Romanticism -- it is elegantly minimalist.

## Why pedals?

When I had guests, I asked them for a hand to mill as it gets rather physical after 10 min non-stop. 
Although I personally find that fun, my "sweating before eating" policy was not unanimously acclaimed -- sad days. 
In addition, some people of smaller stature would not even manage to actually mill hard grains.
Therefore, I started a crazy project aiming at putting the mill on pedals -- thus keeping its positive attributes whilst making it more efficient. 
I thought it would be fun to share the latest version of my design my design with the other lunatics crawling the web.
The wondermill is already quite expensive, and I was reluctant to spend any more money. 
My philosophy for this project was, therefore, to recycle/repurpose as much as possible.

On this page, I just put together the prerequisites as well as minimal assembly instructions and blueprints.


## Project prerequisites

The skills:

* Basic woodworking (tenon and mortices). 
* Basic 3D printing
* Very basic knowledge of bicycle mechanics

The parts:

* About 3m of sturdy wood (e.g. 3x2 construction timber, I found mine in a skip)
* An old bicycle frame with crank and pedals attached (ideally a broken rusty vintage one. I found mine actually abandoned in a wood)
* A chain, derailleur and cassette
* A 3D printed adaptor to fit the cassette on the mill
* The wondermill itself
* A pair of G clamps

Tools and consumables:

* Wood saw, mallet, chisels
* Wood glue and clamps
* Hard string
* 5 screws for wood
* Hacksaw and file 


## Assembly

Obviously, the design will depend on what material you find and, I hope, your own improvements/adaptations.

### The holder

The holder is the wooden chassis that holds everything together. 
The idea is to put together something with these dimensions:

My brother introduced me to woodwork and to the soothing -- and weirdly addictive -- voice of [Paul Sellers](https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork/playlists), which I highly recommend.
I wanted to start my woodworking training with this project.
The important point here is that you want **something quite sturdy** as you will sit and move around. 
If your structure is not rigid enough, the torque on the mill, especially on hard grains, may also warp it, making it less efficient.


### The bicycle and derailleur
For this project, we just need the rear part of the frame: the one that would hold the saddle and the back wheel. 
I used a hacksaw to cut the rest off -- consistently with my effort to minimise the design.
Some people find it hard to balance without a handlebar, so you may want to keep the front of the bike for that.

I wanted to avoid screws when possible. Therefore, I used a chisel to dig groves where the bike should go. I then used hard strings/rope to keep the bike in place. 
I like the simplicity of string and the possibility to remove it (e.g. to for cleaning or transport):

The first prototype I put together did not have a derailleur, which was a mistake. Then the chain did jump a lot especially on large hard grains (e.g. corn), and it was effectively impossible to tune the gear ratio.
Therefore I added a derailleur to the current version:

TODO derailleur fig.

Note that I have cut a small piece of wood to fix he derailleur using its hanger and a couple of screws/bolts.
I first clamped the support until I was happy with its position, and then glued it.
This way, we do not risk damaging the holder and we could relatively simply change the derailleur or its position.

### Mounting the mill

Rather than using a single sprocket (such as [the one sold by the wondermill people](http://www.thewondermill.com/index.php/module/statics/action/view_listing/page/58)), I opted for a cassette, so I can play around with the gear ratio according to what mill.
I 3d printed an adaptor for a shimano cassette that fits the shaft of the wondemill:

Then, instead of screwing or bolting the mill directly to the holder, I put it on a separate board and I clamp the board (using G clamps) when I mill.
This allows me to clean the mill or move it left to right to line up the gear I want:

This design also makes it the millipede modular so that we can remove the mill and other rotation/based instead. For instance, I have put together an millipede-powered apple-crusher.

## Conclusion

I hope you had fun reading about the millipede and that you try building your own and do not hesistate to send me some feed back!
I also hope the wondermill company comes accross this post and strat sending me freebies.
