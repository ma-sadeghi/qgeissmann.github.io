# About

Hey there, I am Quentin, a postdoc in the [Haney](https://haneylab.msl.ubc.ca/) 
and [Carrillo](https://lfs-carrillo.sites.olt.ubc.ca/)
labs at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).
I have always been fascinated by the diversity of life forms, and how different organisms have adapted to a wide range of constraints.
Over the years, I also developed a passion for open-source software which naturally led me to study computational biology, statistics and machine learning.

Plants are colonised by communities of microbes, including both beneficial and pathogenic bacteria.
I am interested in how invertebrates shape the interaction between plant and bacteria, for instance by vectoring microorganisms. 
In particular, I work on how bacteria and plants have evolved to attract or deter their respective invertebrate partners.
