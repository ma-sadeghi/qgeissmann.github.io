Hey there, I am Quentin, a final year PhD student in in the [Gilestro lab](https://lab.gilest.ro/) (in Imperial College London). My scientific interests are both in *comparative physiology* and *computational biology*.

Indeed, I have always been interested in the diversity of life forms, and how different organisms have evolved solutions to a wide range constraints.

Over the years, I also developed a passion for open-source software which naturally led me to study computational biology, statistics and machine learning.


I am currently part of a multidisciplinary team where I work right at the intersection between my two interests.
My collaborators and myself try to understand the *physiology of sleep*, using *Drosophila* as a model.
So far, my main contributions have been to:

* Build the [Ethoscope Platform](https://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope/), a real-time tracking system that monitors hundreds of animals at a time
* Develop [Rethomics](http://rethomics.github.io/), a pipeline to analyse high-throughput behaviour data
* Use these approaches to challenge our understanding of sleep (*e.g.* physiology of sleep deprivation, trade-offs between sleeping and mating)
